# LSTM

LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) is a special kind of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) which 
performs comparatively better than traditional RNN on datasets involving learning long-term  
dependencies. It does so by using a memory unit (cell state) and 3-gates: input, output and 
forget gate.
